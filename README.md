# Drug-Overdose-Patterns
Drug overdose crisis in North America has hit new heights since the 2020 Coronavirus lockdowns. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses between May 2020 and April 2021 - the most ever recorded in a single year. This is a significant 30% increase from 2019 numbers in the US. Harvard newsletter highlights the current underlying crisis currently overshadowed by the impact of coronavirus pandemic in North America as 2020 is likely to be the deadliest year on record for opioid overdoses. Since declaring a health emergency in 2016 in British Columbia, nearly 10,000 people have died from illicit-drug toxicity, a death rate greater than the one associated with COVID-19. Recent monthly data also suggests a rising tide in overdose deaths in same region.

The objective of this project is to find meaning in the current trends of drug overdoses by analysing the main drivers of these group of illicit drugs and prescription opioids. The drug classes used in this project include:

1. Benzodiazepines: - A class of psychoactive drugs
2. Amphetamine (Methamphetamine): - A class of stimulants. 
3. Opioids (including synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl, and Heroin): - A group of pain-relieving drugs.
